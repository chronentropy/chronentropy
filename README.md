# chronentropy

Systems engineer focused on building correct, performant, and production-grade software.

I work primarily in **Rust** and **Go**, with an emphasis on:
- Low-level systems and backend engineering
- Correctness, validation, and failure modes
- Performance, concurrency, and resource control
- Production-quality tooling and infrastructure

---

## Focus Areas

- **Systems Programming**: memory management, concurrency, OS-level concepts  
- **Backend Engineering**: services, configuration, reliability, observability  
- **Rust Internals**: ownership, lifetimes, unsafe code (when justified)  
- **Engineering Discipline**: testing, CI, benchmarks, design clarity  

---

## Philosophy

I optimize for:
- Long-term maintainability over short-term hacks
- Explicitness over magic
- Boring, reliable systems over fragile abstractions

Each project exists to solve a real engineering problem.

## Current Work

- Production-grade configuration validation systems
- CLI tooling with strict correctness guarantees
- Systems-focused Rust projects built from first principles
